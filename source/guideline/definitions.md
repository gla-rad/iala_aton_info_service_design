  <td>External Data Model	</td>
  <td>Describes the semantics of the ‘maritime world’ (or a significant part thereof) by defining data structures and their relations. This could be at logical level (e.g. in UML) or at physical level (e.g. in XSD schema definitions), as for example standard data models, or S-100 based data produce specifications.</td>

<tr>
  <td>Message Exchange Pattern</td>
  <td>Describes the principles two different parts of a message passing system (in our case: the service provider and the service consumer) use to interact and communicate with each other.  Examples:
  </p> In the Request/Response MEP, the service consumer sends a request to the service provider to obtain certain information; the service provider provides the requested information in a dedicated response.
  </p>In the Publish/Subscribe MEP, the service consumer establishes a subscription with the service provider to obtain certain information; the service provider publishes information (either in regular intervals or upon change) to all subscribed service consumers.</td>
